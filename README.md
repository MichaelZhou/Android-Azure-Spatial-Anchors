<h1>Android Azure Spatial Anchors <em>Marking Real World Locations in Augmented Reality for the Cloud</em></h1>

Integrates ARCore and Sceneform to let a user place an object in the real world using the augmented reality in the app and attach a local Azure spatial anchor. This anchor is then uploaded into the cloud and would be viewable by anyone with access to the same Azure Spatial Anchor resource.
